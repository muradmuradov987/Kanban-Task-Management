# Kanban Task Management

Kanban Task Management is a Vue 3 Composition API website that allows you to manage your tasks using the Kanban methodology.

When you first enter the site, you will need to log in or create an account. Once you are logged in, you will see a list of your boards. You can create a new board by clicking the **"Create New Board"** button.

Each board has three columns by default: Todo, Doing, and Done. You can change the names of these columns or add new columns by clicking the **"Edit Board"** button.

To create a new task, click the **"Create New Task"** button in the upper right corner of the screen. In the new task window, you can enter the name of the task, a description, and subtasks. You can also choose which column the task should be in.

To view a task in more detail, click on it. This will open a window where you can see the task's description, subtasks, and status. You can also complete subtasks and move the task to other columns by clicking the corresponding buttons.

To edit or delete a task, click the corresponding buttons in the task's detail window.
